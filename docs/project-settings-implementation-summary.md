# Project Settings Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to implement database persistence for project settings in the Crowdeval application. The implementation ensures that when users change or update project settings, those changes are properly reflected in the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema
- Created a new migration file (`src/lib/db/migrations/001_create_project_settings_table.sql`) to add the `project_settings` table
- The table includes columns for storing different types of settings as JSON:
  - `general_settings`
  - `notification_settings`
  - `privacy_settings`
  - `team_settings`
  - `vendor_settings`
- Added a foreign key constraint to the `projects` table
- Created an index on `project_id` for better performance

### 2. Database Queries
- Added new functions in `src/lib/db/queries.ts`:
  - `createProjectSettings`: Creates or updates project settings in the database
  - `getProjectSettings`: Retrieves project settings from the database
  - `updateProjectSettings`: Updates specific project settings in the database
- Added the `ProjectSettings` interface for type safety

### 3. Project Service
- Added new methods in `src/services/projectService.server.ts`:
  - `createOrUpdateProjectSettings`: Creates or updates project settings
  - `getProjectSettings`: Gets project settings
  - `updateProjectSettings`: Updates project settings
- Used dynamic imports to avoid circular dependencies

### 4. API Endpoints
- Enhanced `src/app/api/dashboard/[projectId]/settings/route.ts`:
  - Modified the GET endpoint to fetch settings from the database first, falling back to default settings if none exist
  - Modified the PUT endpoint to save settings to the database after updating the project
  - Added proper error handling and logging

### 5. Migration Script
- Created `scripts/migrate-project-settings.js` to run the database migration
- Added `db:migrate-settings` script to package.json

### 6. Testing
- Created `test/scripts/project/test-project-settings.js` to test the project settings functionality
- Added `test:project-settings` script to package.json
- Created documentation for testing procedures

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. When a user accesses the Settings tab:
   - The frontend component fetches settings from the API endpoint
   - The API endpoint first tries to retrieve settings from the database
   - If no settings exist, it creates default settings based on the project data and saves them to the database

2. When a user updates settings:
   - The frontend component sends updated settings to the API endpoint
   - The API endpoint updates the project data (name and description)
   - The API endpoint saves all settings to the database
   - The user receives confirmation of successful update

### Database Storage
- Settings are stored in separate JSON columns for each category (general, notifications, privacy, team, vendor)
- This allows for flexible querying and updating of specific settings categories
- The JSON format preserves the structure of the settings data
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

### Error Handling
- All database operations include proper error handling
- Errors are logged and appropriate HTTP status codes are returned
- The frontend displays user-friendly error messages

## Security Considerations
- Only authenticated users with appropriate roles (manager, admin, owner) can access settings
- Project-level access control ensures users can only access settings for projects they belong to
- Database operations use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Settings data is validated before being saved to the database

## Performance Considerations
- Database indexing on `project_id` for faster lookups
- JSON columns allow for efficient storage and retrieval of structured data
- Caching could be implemented in the future for frequently accessed settings

## Future Improvements
1. **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed settings to reduce database load
2. **Validation**: Add more comprehensive validation for settings data before saving
3. **Audit Logging**: Add audit logging for settings changes
4. **Partial Updates**: Optimize the update functionality to only update changed settings
5. **Migration Rollback**: Implement rollback functionality for database migrations

## Testing
The implementation includes:
- Manual testing procedures documented in `docs/testing-project-settings.md`
- Automated test script at `test/scripts/project/test-project-settings.js`
- Unit tests for database queries (in the test/api directory)

## Deployment
To deploy these changes:
1. Run the database migration: `npm run db:migrate-settings`
2. Deploy the updated code to your production environment
3. Verify that the settings functionality works correctly

## Rollback
If you need to rollback these changes:
1. Remove the `project_settings` table from the database
2. Revert the code changes
3. Note that this will permanently delete all project settings data
